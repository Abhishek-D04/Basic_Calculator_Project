# Basic_Calculator_Project
===========================

Project Overview
----------------
The Advanced Calculator is a web-based tool developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It performs basic arithmetic operations, as well as advanced features such as square root calculation, percentage conversion, and memory functions. The calculator also includes a toggle for light and dark themes to enhance user experience.

Features
--------
Basic Features:
- Perform arithmetic operations:
  - Addition (+)
  - Subtraction (-)
  - Multiplication (×)
  - Division (÷)
- Clear the current input and reset the calculator.

Advanced Features:
1. Square Root Calculation (√):
   - Calculates the square root of the current input.
   - Handles invalid inputs (e.g., negative numbers) gracefully by displaying an error.

2. Percentage Calculation (%):
   - Converts the current input into a percentage (e.g., 50 becomes 0.5).

3. Memory Functions:
   - M+: Adds the current input to memory.
   - M-: Subtracts the current input from memory.
   - MR: Recalls the stored memory value.
   - MC: Clears the stored memory value.

Enhanced User Experience:
- Light and Dark Themes:
  - Switch between light and dark modes using the theme toggle button.
